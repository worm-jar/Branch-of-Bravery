Branch of Bravery is an Action 2D Sidescroller where you play as a villain, sent as an envoy of a god to kill an anomaly located at the top of Mount Lunaria. This anomaly took part of this god's consciousness and built a sort of resistance against this selfish god and a refuge for those who were meant to die without a trace.

At the base of the mountain, blocking the path to the peak, is Brave Little Annabeth; A little girl, who can barely carry a sword, and who wants nothing but to protect her family. Branch of Bravery is then a small part of this full game, where you reach and defeat Brave Little Annabeth.

Branch of Bravery is meant to be a Souls-like, with a target audience of those who like to try and try again until they overcome the obstacles in front of them. Something that makes this game unique is the theming. As said above, the player plays as a villain. And the goal of this game is to make the player feel morally wrong about their actions.

The combat of this game is also something that sets it apart. You consume health to deal damage and regenerate by striking enemies with a light attack that deals very little damage. This forces the player to be aggressive in moderation, as you need to get close up and personal to regenerate health, while also dodging and playing reactively to not take damage. It is almost like a proactive dance.

The player is a representation of death with a scythe and a top hat. They went through a couple of redesigns before finding the sweet spot. The final boss, Brave Little Annabeth, with her golden, shiny hair, is designed to stand out from the dark shades of gray and purple of the environment and enemies.

In the story of the game, the anomaly at the top of Mount Lunaria manages his loneliness and boredom by writing poetry, which is how you learn about the lore and story of the game. It is then fitting that the UI is made to look like handwriting on paper.

The main gameplay of this game is the combat, and so I spent a lot of time making the tutorial as streamlined as possible.
